This repo contains my solution for C2C software engineer assessment


### PREREQUISITE 
* Have nodejs installed
* Have postgresql installed

### SETUP
* Ceate your env file based on the .env.sample file provided. Don't change anything (apart from maybe the PORT variable). Just copy and paste into your env file
* Open a tab on your terminal and start your postgresql service
* Open another tab and enter the command `npm run initDB`. This initialises and sets up the database schema
* Now, run `npm start`. You can now access the app on the port number you specified.
